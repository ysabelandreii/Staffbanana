Introduction

This GitHub repository houses the project management and development resources for StaffBanana, a revolutionary mobile application designed to transform timekeeping through the power of facial recognition. StaffBanana eliminates the inefficiencies and inaccuracies of traditional timekeeping methods like manual punching and unreliable badges.  It offers a faster, more secure, and highly reliable way to track employee hours, even in environments with limited or intermittent online connectivity.

While the StaffBanana application itself is a mobile app (not directly hosted here), this GitHub project serves as the central hub for our development process.  We leverage GitHub for:

1. Bug Tracking: All reported bugs, feature requests, and issues are meticulously tracked within this repository's issue tracker.  This allows us to prioritize, assign, and manage bug fixes and improvements effectively.
2. Documentation: Key documentation related to StaffBanana's architecture, API, development process, and deployment procedures is maintained and versioned within this repository. This ensures that the entire team has access to the most up-to-date information.
3. Planning: We utilize GitHub's project boards and milestones to plan sprints, manage tasks, and track the overall progress of StaffBanana's development.  This facilitates collaboration and ensures transparency across the development team.

This repository, therefore, provides a comprehensive overview of the development lifecycle of StaffBanana, from initial planning to ongoing maintenance and feature enhancements.  While the application itself is distributed through the appropriate app stores, this GitHub project provides valuable insight into the development process behind StaffBanana's innovative timekeeping solution.
